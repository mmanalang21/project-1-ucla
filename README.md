## Purpose
Create a real-world front-end application to be able to showcase to potential employers. This application was developed to fulfill a demand for travelers looking for local coffee roasteries. End users can use Raving Roasteries to get a list of coffee roasteries based on their zipcode. They will have the option to click on a link to view information based on their selection and store past zipcode searches.
